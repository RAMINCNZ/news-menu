## Description

This custom module for webtrees introduces a news management system. It extends the functionality of the main menu by adding an extra item that serves as a portal to the news section. The news management system allows users to attach images to their news posts, enriching the content with visual elements. This feature not only provides a more engaging user experience but also promotes better content organization and presentation. Furthermore, the module includes a commenting system for news posts. This feature fosters interaction between users, allowing them to express their thoughts and opinions on the news. In addition, the module introduces a 'like' functionality for news posts. This allows users to express their approval or interest in a news post, providing another layer of engagement. Finally, the module provides the ability to schedule news posts for future dates. This feature allows users to plan their news content ahead of time, ensuring that their news is always timely and relevant.In conclusion, this module significantly enhances the news management capabilities of webtrees, providing a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, and interacting with news content. This module is inspired by a [jp-main-menu-manual](https://github.com/jpretired/jp-main-menu-manual) and [simple-menu-module](https://github.com/JustCarmen/webtrees-simple-menu)
